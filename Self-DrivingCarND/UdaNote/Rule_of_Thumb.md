1. A change that affects 30 examples in validation set,is usually statistically significant and typically can be trusted. That's why for most classification tasks people tend to hold back more than 30,000 examples for validation. This makes accuracy figures significant to the first decimal place and give enough resolution to see small improvements.**Didn't fit to the unbalance problem**
